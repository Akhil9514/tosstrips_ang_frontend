                <h2>Our Origin

                  <hr>
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Brothers Travis and Shawn Pittman left Queensland, Australia, to live and work in London, UK, where their experiences opened their eyes to the transformative power of travel.
                    <br><br>
Like many startup founders, their idea for tossntrips was born out of a frustrating personal experience. While trying to book a one-week sailing tour in Croatia through a US-based company, they discovered just how complicated — and risky — the process could be. They spent hours trawling through countless websites, brochures, and magazines, transferred money to a company they weren’t even sure was legitimate, struggled to arrange transportation to and from the airport, and wandered through a foreign town just to locate the tour operator’s tiny office.
<br><br>
That experience sparked a realization: there had to be a better, safer, and simpler way to book travel experiences. And from that insight, tossntrips was born.
