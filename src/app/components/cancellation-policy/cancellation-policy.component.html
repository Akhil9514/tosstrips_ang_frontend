              <h3>TossnTrips – Cancellation & Refund Policy</h3>
              <p>
At TossnTrips, we understand that sometimes travel plans may change. To ensure fairness and transparency, please review our cancellation and refund terms carefully before booking.                <br>
               
              </p>
              <h3>General Cancellation Terms</h3>
             <ul>
                <li>All cancellation and refund requests must be submitted <b>in writing</b>.</li>
                <li>All confirmed bookings are subject to an <b>administrative handling fee of US $500 per person</b>, in addition to any supplier-imposed cancellation charges.</li>
                <li>Refunds (less handling fees and supplier charges) will only be processed if your written cancellation request is received <b>at least 60 days prior to departure</b>.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Because TossnTrips must prepay suppliers such as cruise lines, luxury trains, and hotels well in advance, refunds depend on each supplier’s terms and conditions. Some suppliers may issue <b>travel vouchers or credits</b> instead of cash refunds. TossnTrips cannot be held responsible for supplier insolvency or failure to process refunds.</p>

              <h3>Cancellation Fees Timeline</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to supplier-imposed fees, TossnTrips applies the following charges based on the time of cancellation before departure:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>59 – 35 days prior:</b> 25% of total tour price</li>	
                <li><b>34 – 14 days prior:</b> 50% of total tour price</li>	
                <li><b>Less than 14 days prior:</b> No refund</li>	
              </ul>
              <p>No refunds will be issued for unused accommodations, missed services, or portions of a tour once it has started. If you cancel during the trip, no partial refunds will apply.</p>
              <h3>Refund Claims</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>	All refund claims must be submitted within 30 days of tour termination.</li>	
                <li>	Claims received after this period will not be considered.</li>	
                <li>	Any complaints must be endorsed in writing by the relevant service provider.</li>	

              </ul>
              
             
              <h3>Airfare Rules</h3>
              <p>
               Airfares are subject to different cancellation regulations, which may include penalties or complete non-refundable terms. Please check with us or the airline at the time of booking.
              </p>
              <h3>Strongly Recommended: Travel Protection</h3>
              <p>To safeguard your investment, <b>comprehensive travel insurance is highly recommended</b>. This protects against unexpected cancellations, medical emergencies, or force majeure events beyond our control.</p>
             
              <h3>Cancellation by TossnTrips</h3>
              <p>
              If TossnTrips cancels a tour (other than due to force majeure), our liability is limited to a <b>full refund of your deposits</b>. We will not be responsible for additional costs such as independently booked flights or accommodations.
              </p>
              <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
              <p>
                 In circumstances beyond our control (“force majeure”), TossnTrips may need to cancel prior to departure or alter services during the trip. In such cases, no refunds or compensation will be made, and our standard cancellation terms will apply.
              </p>
               <p>Examples of force majeure include but are not limited to:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, storms, wildfires)</li> 
                  <li>Acts of God</li> 
                  <li>War, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes</li> 
                  <li>Epidemics, pandemics, or government-imposed restrictions</li> 
                  <li>Transport delays, cancellations, or technical failures</li> 
                  <li>Any other event outside TossnTrips’ control</li> 
               </ul>
               <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
               <p>
                While cancellations can be disappointing, our priority is to be transparent, fair, and supportive throughout the process. TossnTrips will always do its best to liaise with suppliers on your behalf and minimize your financial loss wherever possible
