              <h3>TossnTrips – Terms & Conditions</h3>
              <p>
              Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully. They outline the basis on which TossnTrips operates its tours and services, and they also limit our liabilities. By booking with TossnTrips, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as the applicable terms and conditions of third-party suppliers (such as hotels, airlines, rail companies, cruise operators, and car rental providers).
              <br><br>
              The terms <b>“we,” “us,” “our,” and “TossnTrips”</b> refer to TossnTrips. The terms <b>“you” and “traveler”</b> refer to the customer visiting our website, and/or booking travel arrangements through us.
               
              </p>
              <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
              <p>
                By making a booking with TossnTrips, you accept and agree to these Terms and Conditions. If you are a lead traveler or a travel agent, you assume responsibility for ensuring all participants in your booking are made aware of and comply with these Terms. Failure to do so will not exempt travelers from their obligations.
                <br><br>
                 TossnTrips reserves the right to update or amend these Terms at any time. Any material changes will be communicated, and continued use of our services implies acceptance of the updated terms.

              </p>
              <h3>
                2. Reservations, Deposits & Payments
              </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>A <b>non-refundable planning fee of US $500 per person</b> is required to confirm your reservation.</li> 	
                <li>Full payment must be received <b>no later than 60 days before departure.</b></li> 	
                <li>For cruises, flights, luxury trains, or other services requiring advance payment, a higher deposit may be required.</li> 	
                <li>Bookings made within <b>60 days of departure</b> must be paid in full at the time of confirmation.</li> 	
                <li>TossnTrips reserves the right to cancel your booking if payments are not received on time and apply cancellation fees as per our Cancellation Policy.</li> 	
              </ul>
              <p>Any post-booking changes will incur a <b>minimum charge of US $100 per person per change.</b></p>
             <h3>3. Payment Authorization</h3>
             <p>
              We accept major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover). By authorizing a payment, you agree not to dispute or charge back for cancellations (except in cases of proven fraud). Attempted chargebacks will result in recovery of costs, fees, and legal expenses. Travel agents are financially responsible for chargebacks initiated by their clients.
             </p>
             <h3>4. Substitutions & Itinerary Changes</h3>
             <p>
              While we make every effort to deliver your planned itinerary, circumstances beyond our control may require substitutions. TossnTrips may replace services or accommodations with alternatives of equal quality without it being considered a material change or cause for cancellation.
              <br><br>
              During holidays, peak seasons, strikes, or unforeseen closures, certain facilities may be unavailable. We will provide alternatives where possible but cannot guarantee exact experiences.
             </p>
             <h3>5. Travel Protection</h3>
             <p>
              We strongly recommend purchasing comprehensive travel insurance that covers trip cancellation, interruption, medical expenses, evacuation, baggage loss, and “cancel for any reason” coverage. Without insurance, you assume full responsibility for losses arising from unforeseen events.
               <br><br>
              Some countries require proof of valid medical insurance upon entry. TossnTrips is not responsible for denied entry due to lack of required insurance or documentation.
             </p>
             <h3>6. Prices & Rate Adjustments</h3>
             <ul>
                <li>All prices are quoted in <b>U.S. Dollars</b> unless otherwise stated.</li>
                <li>Prices are based on current exchange rates, tariffs, and taxes at the time of your proposal.</li>
                <li>TossnTrips reserves the right to adjust rates due to changes in tariffs, taxes, fuel surcharges, or foreign exchange.</li>
                <li>Once full payment has been received 60 days prior to departure, prices are guaranteed against surcharges.</li>
             </ul>
             <h3>7. Price Exclusions</h3>
             <p>Unless otherwise stated, tour prices do not include:</p>

              </p>
              <h3>10. Travel Documents</h3>
              <p>
                Travelers are responsible for obtaining valid passports, visas, vaccinations, and other entry requirements. TossnTrips will assist where possible but is not responsible for denied entry or related losses. Passports must be valid for <b>at least six months beyond your return date</b>.
              </p>
              <h3>11. Health & Fitness Requirements</h3>
              <p>
                Travelers must ensure they are fit to participate. TossnTrips reserves the right to deny participation to anyone deemed medically unfit or a risk to themselves or others. Proof of vaccinations may be required depending on the destination.

              <h3>12. Baggage & Airline Rules</h3>

              <h3>13. Traveler Responsibility & Conduct</h3>
              <p>Travelers are expected to act responsibly and comply with local laws, customs, and safety guidelines. TossnTrips reserves the right to remove a traveler from a tour if their behavior disrupts others or poses a safety risk. In such cases, no refunds will be issued.</p>
              <h3>14. Liability Disclaimer</h3>
              <p>TossnTrips acts only as an intermediary between travelers and independent suppliers. We are not liable for:</p>
              <ul>

                <li>Loss, injury, or damage resulting from natural disasters, wars, terrorism, epidemics, strikes, or government actions</li>
                <li>Delays, schedule changes, or equipment failures</li>
                <li>Improper documentation leading to denied entry</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Travel is inherently subject to risks. By booking, you acknowledge these risks and agree that TossnTrips is not responsible for circumstances beyond our control.
              </p>
              <h3>15. Governing Law & Venue</h3>
